# ML Adventures
Learning Machine Learning. Starting out the process of learning with my trusty sidekick, Raven.

#### 7th July, 2018: 
Starting out by understanding the [Rasa NLU](https://github.com/GauravG8/rasa_nlu)

#### 9th July, 2018:
Exploring Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colaboratory (https://github.com/GauravG8/ML/blob/master/Hello%2C_Colaboratory.ipynb)

Added Reminders support to Dialogflow for Raven

#### 11th July, 2018
Working on the Machine Learning Map. Discussions on ML to figure out the next path. Currently, chose to go with NLP.

#### 12th July, 2018
Understanding how to build a text summarizer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrJaOIuBx4). Still a long way to go.
Terms to understand:
* Syntatic Parsing
* Pickle & Keras
* Word Vectors: word2vec & GloVe
* Sequence to sequence
* LSTM

#### 13th July, 2018
Conversations on ML regarding text and image processing. Laying out and undeerstanding what had been learnt so for. Understanding Numerical representations of data for Machine learning (word2vec & image matix representation)

#### 16th July, 2018
Concepts to explore:
* AlphaGo
* Deep Q
* Wavenet
* scikit-learn
* Gradient Descent Algorithm
* Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

* Retrieval Model - Hardcoded responses
* Generative Model - Trained with datset

##### Neural Conversational Model (Torch & Lua)

1. Load dataset
2. Build Model - Sequence to Sequence Model (2 LSTMs)
3. Training Parameters - 
   * Negative Log Likelihood - to improve sentence predictions
   * Learning Rate & Momentum - help pace timesteps 
   * Decay Factor & Min Mean Error - helps improve learning rate while training
4. Enable CUDA
5. Train the model using backpropagation
